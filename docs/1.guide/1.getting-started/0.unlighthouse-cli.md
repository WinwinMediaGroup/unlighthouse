## Introduction

The Unlighthouse CLI provides the quickest way to scan your website's Google Lighthouse performance. It requires minimal setup and provides instant feedback through a local development interface.

::

## Setup

### Requirements

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- Chrome or Chromium browser (will be auto-installed if missing)

### Quick Start

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dlx unlighthouse --site <your-site>
```

::

::tip
Unlighthouse automatically detects and uses your system Chrome or Chromium installation. If neither is found, it will download a compatible Chromium binary.
::

### How It Works

When you run the CLI command:

1. Unlighthouse crawls your site starting from the provided URL
2. Discovers all internal pages automatically
3. Runs Google Lighthouse audits on each page
4. Opens a local UI to view results in real-time

For detailed CLI options and configuration, see the [CLI Integration](/integrations/cli) guide.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows WSL

::warning
Windows Subsystem for Linux users may encounter connection issues with the Chrome instance.
::

For WSL-specific solutions, see [Common Errors Guide](/guide/guides/common-errors#connect-econnrefused-127001port).
